// At each sample the phase is incremented by frequency/4. It is then used to
// compute the output of the oscillator depending on the waveform.
// This means the frequency unit is 65536*4/31000 or about 8.456Hz
// and the frequency range is 0 to 554180Hz. Maybe it would be better to adjust
// the scaling factor to allow less high frequencies (they are useless) but
// more fine grained resolution. Not only we could play notes more in tune,
// but also we would get a more subtle vibrato effect.

// ... and that's it for the engine, which is very simple as you see.
// The parameters for the oscillators can be updated in your game_frame callback.
// Since the audio buffer is generated in one go it is useless to try to tweak
// the parameters more often than that.
